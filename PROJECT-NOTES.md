# Project Notes — Well Testing Suite

Running log of significant changes, fixes, and architectural decisions. Newest entries on top.
All changes land on `dev`; `master` is the stable tree consumed by the iOS sync workflow.

## Subscription — 3-day free trial → $9.99 / month (iOS)

**Goal**: Monetise the iOS app via a single auto-renewing subscription tier
with a 3-day free trial. Whole-app gating (no free tier inside the app).

**Product**
- Product ID: `com.h2oil.welltesting.pro.monthly`
- Subscription group: `H2Oil Pro`
- Price: $9.99 USD / month (configurable per territory in App Store Connect)
- Intro offer: 3-day free trial (one-time, first-time subscribers)
- T&C URL: https://h2oil.sitify.app (must also be set as the EULA in App Store
  Connect → App Information)

**Files added / changed**
- `ios-app/package.json` — added `@squareetlabs/capacitor-subscriptions` dep
- `ios-app/ios-additions/ios-subscriptions.js` — StoreKit bridge, cached
  entitlement, purchase/restore flows, paywall show/hide gate
- `ios-app/ios-additions/ios-paywall.html` — paywall DOM (injected at `</body>`)
- `ios-app/ios-additions/ios-paywall.css` — full-screen overlay styles
- `ios-app/scripts/sync-from-main.js` — injects the paywall HTML/CSS/JS into
  `www/index.html`, same way the rest of the iOS additions are layered in

**How the gate works**
1. On launch, `ios-subscriptions.js` reads a cached entitlement from
   localStorage (mirrored into Preferences for iCloud backup). If still
   valid (not expired) the paywall stays hidden — this means the app works
   offline for subscribers.
2. In the background, it queries StoreKit (`getCurrentEntitlements`). On
   success it updates the cache; on failure it keeps the cached value. If
   neither path yields an active entitlement, the paywall overlay is shown
   and blocks the rest of the UI (`z-index: 10000`, scroll lock).
3. Subscribe button calls `purchaseProduct({ productIdentifier: PRODUCT_ID })`.
   Apple's StoreKit sheet handles the 3-day free trial automatically because
   the intro offer is configured in App Store Connect.
4. Restore Purchases calls `restorePurchases()` (mandatory per App Store
   Review Guideline 3.1.1).
5. `visibilitychange` re-evaluates on return from background (catches
   subscriptions cancelled/renewed in Settings).

**Apple compliance checklist** (avoids 3.1.2 rejection)
- [x] Price shown before purchase CTA
- [x] Duration shown before purchase CTA ("monthly")
- [x] Trial duration and terms shown
- [x] Auto-renewal disclosure present ("automatically renews unless cancelled
      at least 24 hours before the end of the current period")
- [x] Links to EULA (T&C) and Privacy Policy present on paywall
- [x] Restore Purchases button present
- [x] StoreKit used (no external payment)

**App Store Connect setup (must be done on Apple's side too)**
1. My Apps → H2Oil → Subscriptions → create subscription group "H2Oil Pro"
2. Add subscription:
   - Reference name: `H2Oil Pro Monthly`
   - Product ID: `com.h2oil.welltesting.pro.monthly`
   - Duration: 1 Month
   - Price: Tier matching $9.99 USD
3. Add Introductory Offer:
   - Type: Free
   - Duration: 3 Days
   - Eligibility: New subscribers
4. Localization — add display name + description (required before review)
5. App Information → set EULA URL to https://h2oil.sitify.app (or use Apple
   standard EULA if your T&C doesn't add anything)
6. App Privacy → declare "Purchases" data type
7. Review Information → add a sandbox test account with the subscription so
   the reviewer can test without being charged

**Dev helper** — reset cached entitlement in Safari Web Inspector:
```js
window.__h2oilResetEntitlement()
```
This is only enabled inside the native wrapper; safe to leave in (no harm
since it only affects the local cache — the next live StoreKit query will
restore the correct state).

**Not included (on purpose)**
- Server-side receipt validation — StoreKit 2 signs receipts and the plugin
  validates locally, which is fine for a utility app at this scale. Add a
  backend only if we see meaningful fraud.
- Analytics / paywall A/B — can bolt on RevenueCat later without code
  changes from the user's perspective (they'll see the same paywall).
- Multi-tier (monthly + annual) — stick with monthly only until we have
  conversion data. Adding annual is 10 lines in `ios-subscriptions.js`
  plus an extra product in App Store Connect.

## App Store rejection fix (Guideline 2.3.8 — placeholder-looking icons)

**Reviewer feedback**: "The app icons appear to be placeholder icons."

**Root cause**: My first `make-assets.py` composed the H2Oil wordmark at 72%
width on the 1024×1024 canvas, leaving ~60% of the area as dark empty space.
At small sizes (60pt home-screen, 40pt spotlight) the logo shrank into a tiny
mark surrounded by a dark square — reviewers correctly read this as "default
dark-square placeholder with a logo pasted in the middle."

**Fix**:
- Auto-crop the source logo to its alpha bounding box (removes the built-in
  padding in the PNG).
- Scale the wordmark to **92% of the icon's longest axis** — leaves just
  enough margin for iOS's corner rounding without wasting area. The H₂OIL
  wordmark with droplet now fills the icon and is legible from 20pt spotlight
  through 1024pt App Store listing.
- Splash bumped to 60% fill (from 50%) for visual parity with the icon.
- Dropped the droplet-only variant — while cleaner at tiny sizes, losing the
  "H2Oil" wordmark made it a generic oil-drop symbol that wouldn't help users
  identify the app.

Regenerate after any logo change:
```bash
cd ios-app && npm run assets   # make-assets.py → @capacitor/assets → ios/
```

## PDF export on iOS (real fix — prior one was a no-op)

**Problem**: PDF export on iOS never triggered the bundled jsPDF pipeline —
it still fell through to `window.print` which WKWebView handles poorly, AND
the cover page (client info + client logo + H2Oil logo) was missing.

**Root cause**: `exportReport` and `buildReportHTML` live inside the main app's
top-level IIFE (`(function(){...})()`). They were never attached to `window`,
so the iOS bridge's `window.exportReport = ...` assignment created an
unrelated global that no internal call site ever touched. Every calculator
calls the local `exportReport` (resolved lexically inside the IIFE), which
took the popup/iframe print path.

**Fix**:

- `well-testing-app.html`: added two minimal hooks right next to the existing
  definitions —
  - `window.buildReportHTML = buildReportHTML` so wrappers can build the
    styled HTML report with the cover page.
  - At the top of `exportReport`: `if (typeof window.__reportOverride === 'function') return window.__reportOverride(title, contentHTML)`.
- `ios-bridge.js`: sets `window.__reportOverride` instead of overriding
  `window.exportReport`. The override calls `window.buildReportHTML` (picks up
  client info + client logo + H2Oil logo automatically), converts to PDF
  via bundled jsPDF + html2canvas, then saves via `Filesystem.writeFile` +
  native share sheet.

**Also hardened `getH2OilLogoBlack`**: iOS WKWebView's `ctx.filter='invert(1)'`
is unreliable. Added a per-pixel invert fallback (reads the ImageData, flips
RGB when the average brightness is still high after drawImage), so the H2Oil
logo on the PDF cover is guaranteed black on the white cover page.

**Client info on PDF** (what the user asked about):
`buildReportCoverHTML()` already pulls from `localStorage.h2oil_client_info`
and emits a `<div class="logo-row">` (client logo + H2Oil logo) and a
`.meta-tbl` (Client, Well, Field, Operator, Rig, Reference, Date, Engineer,
Company). Once the iOS override correctly calls `buildReportHTML`, all of
that flows through to the generated PDF automatically. No separate wiring
needed — the same cover you see on the web version now prints on iOS too.

---

## App icon + splash screen (H2Oil branding)

Source assets live in `ios-app/resources/` and are generated from the sidebar logo
embedded in `well-testing-app.html` (base64 PNG at line ~281).

- `icon.png` (1024×1024, opaque `#0d1117`, logo at 72% width) — App Store icon
- `splash.png` (2732×2732, opaque `#0d1117`, logo at 45% width) — launch image
- `splash-dark.png` — same as splash (app is already dark-themed)
- `icon-foreground.png`, `icon-background.png` — optional Android adaptive pieces

**Regenerate**: `python3 scripts/make-assets.py` (if logo changes) then
`cd ios-app && npx @capacitor/assets generate --ios`. The assets plugin writes
all required sizes into `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/`.

## Full-screen layout fix (portrait top gap + landscape right bar)

**Problem**: Large black gap above the mobile header in portrait, and a black strip
on the right in landscape. Caused by *three* overlapping safe-area mechanisms
stacking on top of each other:

1. `capacitor.config.json → ios.contentInset: "always"` — WKWebView applies its
   own safe-area inset.
2. `StatusBar.overlaysWebView: false` — pushes the whole webview down by the
   status-bar height.
3. CSS `.main { padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top) }` — added another inset.

**Fix** (consistent edge-to-edge strategy):

- `contentInset: "never"` — webview fills the screen.
- `StatusBar.overlaysWebView: true` — status bar sits on top of webview.
- `viewport-fit=cover` (already in `ios-meta.html`) — exposes `env(safe-area-inset-*)`.
- CSS (in `ios-styles.css`) applies insets to the actual UI chrome:
  - Mobile: `.mob-header` absorbs top + left + right insets; `.main` absorbs
    left/right/bottom; drawer `.sidebar` absorbs top/left/bottom.
  - Desktop/tablet: full-height `.sidebar` absorbs top + left; `.main` absorbs right;
    `.page-body` absorbs bottom.
- `html, body { background: var(--bg1) }` so the status-bar / home-indicator gutters
  paint the app colour instead of black.

After the fix the app fills the screen in both orientations; only the actual
status-bar / dynamic-island / home-indicator zones are reserved.

## Calculation fixes (audit batch)

### C1 — Gas choke (calcChoke, dual-choke path)

**Problem**: The gas branch was using a liquid-style equation that ignored pressure ratio,
compressibility, and critical-flow behaviour. Output was off by ~30-50%.

**Fix**: Rewrote the gas branch to Thornhill-Craver / Economides form:
```
q[MSCF/D] = 879.77·Cd·A·P1·√( (k/(k-1))·(r^(2/k) − r^((k+1)/k)) / (SG·T·Z) )
```
with `r = max(P2/P1, r_crit)` where `r_crit = (2/(k+1))^(k/(k-1))`, Sutton pseudocriticals,
and Papay Z-factor at upstream conditions. Verified against textbook worked example
(32/64" @ 3000 psig → 10.71 MMSCFD critical flow).

File: `well-testing-app.html:~1748-1761`

### C2 — Orifice meter (calcOilGas, AGA-3 path)

**Problem**: Used a fixed discharge coefficient and no Reynolds-dependent iteration, so
readings drifted from AGA-3 reference by several percent at extreme beta / Re.

**Fix**: Full Reader-Harris/Gallagher Cd correlation with a 5-iteration Reynolds loop and
the AGA-3 constant 338.178. Matches ISO 5167-2 / API MPMS 14.3.1 to <0.1%.

File: `well-testing-app.html:~5454-5483`

### C3 — Solution GOR (calcSolGOR, Standing 1947)

**Problem**: Formula grouped terms incorrectly; result was off by a factor that grew with
pressure.

**Fix**: Corrected grouping:
```
Rs = γg · [ (P_psia/18.2 + 1.4) · 10^(0.0125·API − 0.00091·T) ]^1.2048
```

## Well Test Simulator (WTS)

### Build
Full flow tree: Wellhead → **SSV** → Choke → Heater → Separator → Flare, with side
branches Separator → Surge Tank → **Atmospheric Tank**. Each node calculates its own
P, T, velocity from the upstream conditions and line geometry.

### Pipe sizing input
Added wellhead pipeline size input so upstream velocity check uses the actual flowline ID
rather than assuming choke bore.

### Choke → downstream coupling
Previously only choke size changed. Now the downstream nodes recalculate:
- P2 via Thornhill-Craver back-solve (bisection on pressure ratio under fixed q)
- T2 via Joule-Thomson estimate `ΔT ≈ μ_JT · ΔP` with μ_JT ~ 7 °F/100 psi for gas
- V via actual gas volume at P2,T2 through downstream ID
- Erosional check: `V_e = C/√ρ` (API RP 14E, C=100 continuous / 125 intermittent)

### Atmospheric tank branch
Surge tank overflow now routes to a second tank held at atmospheric pressure, with its own
line sizing and velocity readout.

### Node added: SSV
Surface Safety Valve shown upstream of choke, downstream of wellhead. No pressure drop in
normal operation — it's an annunciator node.

## Flare simulator — 2D / 3D touch support

**Problem**: Canvases were mouse-only; pinch-zoom and drag didn't work on iPad/iPhone.

**Fix**: Added `touchstart`/`move`/`end`/`cancel` listeners to both flare canvases, with
`{passive:false}` + `preventDefault()` to stop the page scrolling while dragging. Single
finger drags; two fingers pinch-zoom via `Math.hypot(dx, dy)` distance delta.

Also changed `canvas { touch-action: manipulation }` → `touch-action: none` in
`ios-styles.css` so JS owns the gesture instead of the browser consuming it.

2D canvas also got tap-to-mark and double-tap-to-clear for radiation contour drops.

---

## iOS app

### Architecture
Capacitor 6 wrapper around the existing HTML app. No code fork — `scripts/sync-from-main.js`
reads the root HTML and injects three iOS-only additions:

1. **ios-meta.html** → after `<meta name="viewport">`: status-bar style, web-app-capable.
2. **ios-styles.css** → inside the existing `<style>` block: safe-area-inset padding on
   `.sidebar`/`.main`/`#pgBody`, `touch-action:none` on canvas, 16px inputs (kills iOS zoom).
3. **ios-bridge.js** → inside the main IIFE before `})();`: haptics, native share, PDF
   override, Preferences mirror, status bar.

Then copies bundled libs (`jspdf.umd.min.js`, `html2canvas.min.js`) into `www/`.

### Auto-sync from `master` → `www/`
`.github/workflows/ios-sync.yml` triggers on push to `main`/`master`/`dev` when any of:
- `well-testing-app.html`
- `ios-app/ios-additions/**`
- `ios-app/scripts/sync-from-main.js`

...changes. It runs the sync script and commits the new `www/index.html` back with
`[skip ci]` so the commit doesn't re-trigger itself.

### Native bridge (ios-bridge.js)
- **Haptics** — medium impact on buttons whose label starts with "calculate", light on
  everything else.
- **Native save/share** — intercepts `<a download>` clicks. `data:` URLs decoded inline;
  `blob:` URLs fetched and converted to base64 via `FileReader.readAsDataURL`. Then
  `Filesystem.writeFile({directory:'CACHE'})` + `Share.share({url: res.uri})` shows the
  native share sheet (Save to Files, Mail, Print, etc).
- **Exposed** `window.iosSaveFile(name, b64OrText, isBase64)` for any code that wants to
  bypass the `<a download>` pattern.
- **PDF export** — overrides `window.exportReport(title, html)`: renders the report into an
  off-screen 794×1123 iframe, `html2canvas` at 2× scale → PNG → jsPDF A4 multi-page PDF →
  base64 → `writeAndShare()`. Falls back to the original `exportReport` if anything throws.
- **Status bar** — dark style, `#0d1117` background.
- **App lifecycle** — fires `app-backgrounded` DOM event when `appStateChange` goes inactive.
- **Preferences mirror** — every `localStorage.setItem` also writes to Capacitor
  `Preferences` (iCloud-backup-eligible).
- **Pinch lock** — `gesturestart` preventDefault to stop Safari's built-in pinch zoom.

## iOS fixes (chronological)

### Black screen on first launch
**Cause**: my initial CSS had `html, body { position: fixed; height: 100% }`, which
collided with the existing `body { display: flex }` layout — nothing painted.
**Fix**: removed the position/size overrides. Safe-area handling now lives on
`.sidebar` / `.main` / `#pgBody` only. `html, body` just get `overscroll-behavior: none`.

### PDF / PNG / CSV exports not saving on device
**Cause**: original bridge used `atob()` + `Blob()` which corrupts binary on iOS WKWebView.
**Fix**: pass base64 straight to `Filesystem.writeFile` with no decoding; iOS writes it
to the app cache as a real file, then `Share.share({url: res.uri})` opens the native
share sheet. Works for any `<a download>` click in the app, no per-calculator changes
needed.

### PDF export was just window.print (unreliable in WKWebView)
**Cause**: the web version's `exportReport` calls `window.print`. That opens the system
print dialog on iOS but doesn't produce a file you can Save to Files / email.
**Fix**: bundled `jspdf.umd.min.js` (358 KB) and `html2canvas.min.js` (195 KB) into
`ios-additions/libs/`; sync script copies them next to `index.html`. On native, the bridge
overrides `window.exportReport` with a real PDF generator. Falls back to print if the
libraries fail to load.

### Flare 3D canvas unmovable on touch
See "Flare simulator — 2D / 3D touch support" above.

### `xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active directory ...`
**Cause**: user's `xcode-select` was pointing at `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
instead of a full Xcode.app install.
**Fix**: `setup.sh` detects this and runs
`sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` after prompting.

### `Could not find installation of TypeScript`
**Cause**: `capacitor.config.ts` forced Capacitor to load TypeScript at CLI time.
**Fix**: converted to `capacitor.config.json` (no TS runtime dependency).

### `node: command not found`
**Fix**: `setup.sh` auto-installs Homebrew → Node → CocoaPods if missing. Handles both
Apple Silicon (`/opt/homebrew`) and Intel (`/usr/local`) prefixes via `brew shellenv`.

## Branch conventions

- `master` — stable, iOS sync source. Do not commit directly.
- `dev` — active development target. All edits land here; merged to `master` via PR.
- Old `claude/**` branches are retired. Workflow path filter updated accordingly.

---

## App Store submission (abridged)

From `ios-app/README.md`:

Capabilities required in App ID (App Store Connect → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles):
- None beyond the defaults. No push, no HealthKit, no background modes.

Archive flow: Xcode → Product → Scheme → "Any iOS Device (arm64)" → Product → Archive →
Distribute App → App Store Connect → Upload. No entitlement surprises because we only
use Filesystem (cache dir), Share, Haptics, StatusBar, Preferences, App lifecycle.

Privacy: no data leaves the device. `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` not required. Declare
"Data Not Collected" in the App Privacy form.
